//Auto Save Frequency Modifiers
//You may use the following script functions to override the default auto save interval which is 1 year.

Auto Save Interval Days=30
//This sets the auto save interval in game days.
//Example:
//Auto Save Interval Days=20
//This will make the game write a new auto save file every 20 game days.

//Examples:
//COO Salary Modifier=70
//The expected salary for COO will become 70% of the original range.
